Project Planning:

25 March - review project scope and goals, create plan. HOME - access to Visual Studio - start using python build in functions to interogate data. Basic interrogation complete. 

26 March - WORK TRAVEL - get some initial information for Fisher Data Set (FDS) and focus on initial investigation
27 March - WORK TRAVEL - review python tutorial and highlight relevant sections that may be useful during interogation of FDS, aim to have first draft of FDS background investigation 
28 March - 1st April HOLIDAY
2/3 April - HOME - access to Visual Studio - additional functions ready to test in VS? e.g. loops/functions?
4 - 11 April - WORK TRAVEL - focus on explaining functions used and why, ensure sufficient comments in github to date. Look into next phase of investigation.
11 - 22 April - Work from CPH - finish write up
22 April - HOME - access to Visual Studio - finish python script testing.
22 April - Ready for submission
27 - 28 April - contingency time although limited access to Visual Studio

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it. 
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project. 
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it. 
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you. 
5. Write a summary of your investigations. 
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary

Notes from Video: 
1. Investigation - read me

2. python scripts
min max average
median data spread std deviation histogram

problem - manage work, break down tasks

keep notes - paragraph here and there builds up
keep references
Look up how to build table in "read me"
histogram, scatter plots - minitab? 
pictures...?
