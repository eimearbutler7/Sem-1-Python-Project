## What is the Fisher Iris Dataset? 
This dataset contains a 150 records where 5 attributes of Iris flowers are examined:
⋅⋅*	Petal Length 
⋅⋅* Petal Width
⋅⋅*	Sepal Length
⋅⋅*	Sepal width
⋅⋅*	Class

The 3 flower species in scope are: 


*Iris setosa* &nbsp; *Iris versicolor* &nbsp; *Iris virginica*

Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus"<sup>1</sup>


Why Fisher?

The dataset is big and interesting enough to be non-trivial, but small enough to "fit in your pocket", and not slow down experimentation with it
